This repository contains core implementation of ML life cycle equipped with standardized coding guidelines and best practices for ML architecture and processes.
P.S currently the codebase is in WIP. Will continue to develop this repository over time.

Motivation:
----
Most of the exploratory ML codes are either poorly structured or do not follow consistent code guidelines and processes.
Due to this ad-hoc nature of codebase, it becomes challenging to move core implementation of ML pipelines to production.

Solution:
---
Idea is to treat every ML code as a software - following standard software design principles right from proof-of-concept work until the code reaches production. 
This codebase is a centralized repository solving common ML problems in an efficient and reproducible way thereby saving development time and effort.

The codebase aims to address some of the common ML challenges as below:
1. resolve inconsistent code practices - naming conventions, folder structure, function names
2. ensure standard ML workflows are implemented ensuring quality output
3. shipping ML core implementation from exploration to production

Features of ML code template
---
- Easy to productionize codes, less ad-hoc work

- Easy to integrate with Jupyter notebooks – for exploratory work and experimentation 

- Define generalized ML architecture that can be replicated across common ML problems

- Platform agnostic – same templates can be reproduced/incorporated across different cloud/ on-premise client environments

- Central repository for most of the common ML use-cases

- All common ML libraries supported
